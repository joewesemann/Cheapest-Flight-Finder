Cheapest-Flight-Finder
======================

C++ program that implements Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm by building a graph of flight information from an outside file. It then prompts the user for a starting airport and creates a best price report for the cheapest flights to all destinations, based on the data you give it. 

I made this for school. Hence why its called WolverineAir. I would not have named the airline WolverineAir, that is super lame.
